This is a new sandbox for the new players

Architecture:
The dimensions of the sandbox are 5 meters by 5 meters.

Material:
We use fine sand from Bornhom, which is easy to clean off, but feels nice when playing.

Security:
1. We need a structure to avoid that intruders from other species can enter and engage with the toys
2. We need an alert function to escalate weather hazards to the fire brigade

FAQ:
how can I play with sand?
you can move it around, build shapes, and destroy other players constructions
